## For Clients: Your Access to Case Information

As a client, you have access to information that's been prepared for your review. Here's what you can expect.

### What You Can See

| Content Type | Visibility |
|--------------|------------|
| **Case status** | Always visible for your cases |
| **Public updates** | Updates marked for everyone to see |
| **Client-specific updates** | Updates shared specifically with you |
| **Shared files** | Documents uploaded for your review |
| **Final reports** | Completed reports approved for release |
| **Your own updates** | Anything you've added to the case |

### What You Cannot See

The investigation team maintains certain information internally to protect the integrity of the investigation and ensure confidentiality:

| Content Type | Why It's Restricted |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Internal team notes** | Working notes not yet ready for review |
| **Investigation strategy** | Protects the investigation process |
| **Vendor communications** | Information shared with field investigators |
| **Cost and billing details** | Unless specifically included in your agreement |
| **Other clients' cases** | Each client only sees their own cases |
| **Other parties' contact info** | Privacy protection |

**This is by design.** Restricting access to internal notes ensures you receive clear, verified information rather than preliminary observations that might change.

---

### Requesting Additional Access

If you believe you need access to information you're not currently seeing:

1. **Contact your account manager** — They can discuss what information can be shared
2. **Explain your need** — Help us understand what you're looking for and why
3. **Allow time for review** — Some requests may need internal approval

**Please note:** Some restrictions exist for legal or procedural reasons and cannot be changed. Your account manager will explain any limitations.

## For Vendors: Your Access to Case Information

As a vendor partner, you have access to information needed to complete your assigned work. Here's what you can expect.

### What You Can See

| Content Type | Visibility |
|--------------|------------|
| **Cases assigned to you** | Only cases where you're assigned |
| **Assignment details** | What work is requested |
| **Subject information** | Details needed for your assignment |
| **Vendor-specific updates** | Instructions and information from the team |
| **Public updates** | General updates visible to all parties |
| **Your own submissions** | Work you've submitted |

### What You Cannot See

To protect client confidentiality and maintain professional boundaries:

| Content Type | Why It's Restricted |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Client contact information** | Client privacy protection |
| **Other vendors' work** | Each vendor sees only their assignments |
| **Internal case discussions** | Strategic planning and review |
| **Financial details** | Client billing information |
| **Unassigned cases** | You only see cases you're working on |
| **Client communications** | Private dialogue with the client |

**This protects everyone.** Clients trust that their information stays confidential, and your work products are protected from other vendors.

| Responsibility | Details |

## Adding Updates to Your Case

Both clients and vendors can add updates to cases they're involved with. Here's how it works.

### How to Add an Update

1. Navigate to your case
2. Go to the **Updates** tab
3. Click **Add Update**
4. Enter your update:
   - **Title:** Brief summary of what you're sharing
   - **Content:** Detailed information
   - **Attachments:** Upload any relevant files
5. Click **Submit**

### Where Your Update Appears

When you submit an update:

| If You Are... | Your Update Is Visible To... |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| **Client** | The investigation team + your organization's contacts |
| **Vendor** | The investigation team + your organization's contacts |

**Your updates are NOT visible to:**
- Other clients (if multiple clients on a case)
- Other vendors (each vendor works independently)

---

### Who Can See What You Post

Here's a clear breakdown:

#### If You're a Client

```
Your Update
    │
    ├── ✅ Investigation team (always)
    ├── ✅ Other contacts at your company (if any)
    └── ❌ Vendors (never)
```

#### If You're a Vendor

```
Your Update
    │
    ├── ✅ Investigation team (always)
    ├── ✅ Other contacts at your vendor company (if any)
    └── ❌ Clients (never, unless team shares it)
```

---

### Best Practices for Updates

| Do This | Avoid This |
|---------|------------|
| Use clear, descriptive titles | Vague titles like "Update" or "FYI" |
| Include relevant dates and times | Leaving out important context |
| Attach supporting files | Referencing files you didn't upload |
| Ask questions if unclear | Assuming and proceeding incorrectly |
| Respond to requests promptly | Leaving requests unanswered |

### What Makes a Good Update

**Good Example:**
> **Title:** Surveillance Report - January 15, 2025
>
> **Content:** Completed 6 hours of surveillance at the specified location. Subject arrived at 9:15 AM and departed at 3:45 PM. Full report and photos attached. Please let me know if additional coverage is needed.
>
> **Attachments:** Surveillance_Report_20250115.pdf, Photos.zip

**Less Helpful Example:**
> **Title:** Done
>
> **Content:** Finished the work.
